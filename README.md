# Artificial Intelligence (Project)

The Mystery Solver application is an intelligent decision-support system that uses Bayesian Networks to solve fictional mystery scenarios by calculating the probability of each suspect being guilty based on available evidence. In this project, users enter clues such as alibis, motives, witness statements, fingerprints, or other pieces of evidence, and the system models the relationships between suspects, motives, opportunities, and evidence using probabilistic graphical models. Each clue updates the belief about a suspect’s guilt through Bayesian inference, meaning the system continuously revises probabilities as new information is added. The application demonstrates how uncertainty can be handled mathematically rather than relying on simple rule-based logic, making it more realistic and intelligent. It highlights key concepts such as conditional probability, prior and posterior probabilities, and probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty. Overall, the project combines artificial intelligence and probability theory to create an interactive and educational tool that simulates real-world investigative reasoning in a structured, data-driven way.
